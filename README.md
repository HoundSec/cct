Cloudflare Cache Tester or CCT in short is a web app that can tell you wheather your website is cacched by Cloudflare Edge server or not.

## How Does It Work?

It sends a HTTP get request to the given URL and checks the `Cf-Cache-Status` header value from the HTTP response. Based on the value, it can determine 
wheather the response was cached or not. Read this official [documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/concepts/default-cache-behavior/) by Cloudflare to better understand the comcept.
